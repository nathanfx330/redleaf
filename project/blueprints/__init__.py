# --- File: ./project/blueprints/__init__.py ---

# This file is intentionally left blank.
# Its presence turns the 'blueprints' directory into a Python package,
# allowing the main application in project/__init__.py to import blueprints
# from this directory (e.g., from .blueprints.auth import auth_bp).
