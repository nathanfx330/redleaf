# Redleaf

**Redleaf is a private, local-first knowledge engine.**  
It transforms a directory of documents (PDFs, text, HTML, and transcripts) into a searchable, interconnected knowledge graph ‚Äî all running **entirely on your local machine**.

Built for researchers, archivists, and knowledge workers, Redleaf makes it easy to find meaningful connections across large collections of documents while protecting your privacy.

## üí° Why Redleaf?

Modern researchers often face:

- Hundreds of scattered PDFs, transcripts, and notes.  
- Difficulty recalling where a piece of information came from.  
- Time wasted re-reading documents instead of making connections.  

**Redleaf solves this** by creating a searchable, structured knowledge graph on your own computer.  
It‚Äôs **local-first**, **privacy-respecting**, and designed to let you focus on analysis rather than file management.

## üì¶ Distributing Knowledge: Precomputed Mode

Redleaf can be used not just as a personal tool, but as a way to distribute a fully analyzed dataset. A **Precomputed Knowledge Base** is a Redleaf repository that includes all processed data, allowing users to start exploring immediately without running heavy NLP and indexing steps.  

### The Two Roles

- **Curator:** Gathers documents, processes them, and exports the final state of the knowledge base.  
- **Explorer:** Clones the precomputed repository to search and analyze the data immediately.  

### Workflow for Curators (Creating & Revising)

1. **Revert to Curator Mode:** Delete the `precomputed.marker` file in the `instance/` directory. This re-enables all processing features on the next run.  
2. **Make Revisions:** Run `python run.py` normally. Add/remove documents, re-run processing, update tags, or build catalogs.  
3. **Export the State:** When satisfied, stop the server and run:  
   ```bash
   python bulk_manage.py export-precomputed-state
````

This generates `initial_state.sql`, `manifest.json`, and `precomputed.marker`.
4. **Commit to Git:** Add the exported files and your documents to version control:

```bash
git add documents/
git add project/precomputed_data/ instance/precomputed.marker
git commit -m "Update knowledge base with new research"
git push
```

### Workflow for Explorers (Using)

1. Clone the curator‚Äôs repository.
2. Follow the standard installation steps.
3. Run `python run.py`. Redleaf detects the precomputed state and builds the database automatically.
4. Create a personal account on the welcome screen.
5. Begin exploring immediately.

> **Note:** Data processing buttons (like **Discover Docs** and **Process All**) are intentionally disabled in Precomputed Mode.

### Becoming a Curator (Unlocking Processing Features)

If you want to add your *own* documents:

1. Stop the application.
2. Delete the `precomputed.marker` file in the `instance/` folder.
3. Restart with `python run.py`.

Processing features will now be fully enabled.

* **Precomputed Mode:** Use preprocessed repositories for instant exploration.

### 4. Running the Application

```bash
python run.py
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).
