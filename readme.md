# Redleaf

**Redleaf is a private, local-first knowledge engine.**  
It transforms a directory of documents (PDFs, text, HTML, and transcripts) into a searchable, interconnected knowledge graph ‚Äî all running **entirely on your local machine**.

Built for researchers, archivists, and knowledge workers, Redleaf makes it easy to find meaningful connections across large collections of documents while protecting your privacy.

## üí° Why Redleaf?

Modern researchers often face:

- Hundreds of scattered PDFs, transcripts, and notes.  
- Difficulty recalling where a piece of information came from.  
- Time wasted re-reading documents instead of making connections.  

**Redleaf solves this** by creating a searchable, structured knowledge graph on your own computer.  
It‚Äôs **local-first**, **privacy-respecting**, and designed to let you focus on analysis rather than file management.

## ‚ú® From Text to Knowledge Graph: Automatic Relationship Detection


Redleaf‚Äôs most powerful feature is its ability to understand the *context* that connects the entities it finds. It doesn't just list names and places; it reads the sentences where they appear and intelligently infers the relationship between them.

> For example, imagine you are researching a historical figure by reading their digitized correspondence. A letter might contain the sentence:
>
> "After the telegram arrived from **London**, a meeting was arranged between **Mr. Alistair Finch** and the **ambassador** at the **Blackwood Estate**."
>
> Redleaf instantly pieces together the narrative, creating a map of explorable connections:
> *   `[Mr. Alistair Finch]` ‚Üí `and the` ‚Üí `[ambassador]`
> *   `[ambassador]` ‚Üí `at the` ‚Üí `[Blackwood Estate]`

Now, you can click on the **Blackwood Estate** and instantly see every other document in your collection that mentions it, who else was seen there, and what other events took place on the property.

This transforms your research from a linear reading process into an interactive exploration. You can follow a web of interconnected evidence, discovering patterns and links across your entire collection that would be impossible to find with simple keyword search.

## üì¶ Distributing Knowledge: The Precomputed Model

Redleaf can be used not just as a personal tool, but as a way to distribute a fully analyzed dataset‚Äîlike a museum exhibit in a box. A **Precomputed Knowledge Base** is a Redleaf repository where all heavy NLP and indexing work has already been done, allowing users to start exploring immediately.

### The Two Roles

*   **The Curator:** Gathers and processes documents, enriches the data, and exports the final "exhibit" for distribution.
*   **The Explorer:** Clones the precomputed repository to immediately search, analyze, and add their own local annotations to the data.

### Workflow for Curators (Creating & Revising)

1.  **Work Locally:** Use Redleaf in its standard, fully-featured mode. Add documents, run the processing workflow from the dashboard, update tags, and import contributions from your team.
2.  **Export the State:** When you are ready to publish, stop the server and run the export command. **This is a destructive action for your local instance**‚Äîit will wipe all user accounts to ensure the distributed package is clean.
    ```bash
    python bulk_manage.py export-precomputed-state
    ```
    This generates `instance/initial_state.sql` (the public data) and `instance/precomputed.marker`.
3.  **Commit to Git:** Add the exported files and your documents to your Git repository. This captures the new state of your knowledge base.

### Workflow for Explorers (Using)

1.  Clone the Curator's repository.
2.  Follow the standard installation steps.
3.  Run `python run.py`. Redleaf automatically detects the precomputed state and builds the database from the included files.
4.  When you open your browser, you will be greeted by a special welcome screen. Create your personal, local user account and log in.
5.  Begin exploring immediately. The data processing buttons on the dashboard and advanced system settings will be disabled ("braced for transit") to keep the focus on discovery.

### Becoming a Curator (Removing the Bracing)

If you receive a precomputed knowledge base and later decide you want to add your *own* documents and take over as the curator, you can easily unlock the application's full features.

1.  Stop the application.
2.  Navigate to the `instance/` directory.
3.  **Delete the `precomputed.marker` file.**

The next time you start the application, all processing features will be fully enabled.
