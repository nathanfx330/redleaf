# --- Redleaf Engine Python Dependencies ---
#
# To install all the required libraries, run the following command in your terminal:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# After installing these, you must also download the required spaCy model.

# --- START OF CHANGE ---
# == System-Level Dependencies ==
#
# The following tools are required by the management scripts but are NOT Python packages
# and cannot be installed by pip. Please ensure they are installed on your system.
#
# 1. sqlite3 (Command-Line Tool)
#    - WHY: Required for the `export-precomputed-state` command.
#    - HOW TO CHECK: Open a terminal and run `sqlite3 --version`. If you get a version number, you're all set.
#    - HOW TO INSTALL:
#      - Windows: Download the "command-line tools" zip from the official SQLite website (sqlite.org)
#                 and add the folder containing sqlite3.exe to your system's PATH.
#      - macOS: Usually pre-installed. If not, use Homebrew: `brew install sqlite`
#      - Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install sqlite3`
#      - Linux (Fedora/CentOS): `sudo dnf install sqlite`

# --- IMPORTANT: spaCy Model and GPU Support ---
#
# The main spacy library is listed above, but the application also requires
# a specific pre-trained model to function.
#
# 1. DOWNLOAD THE REQUIRED MODEL:
#    After running 'pip install -r requirements.txt', you MUST download the model with:
#
#    python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
#
# 2. (OPTIONAL) FOR GPU ACCELERATION:
#    If you want to use the GPU acceleration feature, you need to have an
#    NVIDIA GPU with the correct CUDA drivers installed.
#
#    Then, install the version of CuPy that matches your CUDA installation.
#    For example, for CUDA 11.x:
#    pip install cupy-cuda11x
#
#    For CUDA 12.x:
#    pip install cupy-cuda12x
#
#    You can verify if spaCy can access your GPU by running:
#    python check_gpu.py
